The plot should display a discernible minimum in the error values between ranks 80 and 120. The approximation error is higher for ranks lower than 80 because a lower-rank approximation can't capture enough information from the original spectrogram, leading to larger errors. However, for ranks exceeding 120, increasing the rank does not significantly improve the approximation quality, resulting in diminishing returns and therefore higher errors.
