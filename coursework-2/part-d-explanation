Now reporting the result, as n increases the error norms decrease, therefore resulting in a negative correlation.

We need to deduce a relation of the form E_n=O(n^s)
where s represents the rate at which the error norm grows with n.

Hence through the graph, we can deduce that as it is a straight line and linear that would mean the complexity of E_n
would be O(n) where s = 1, which is therefore the relation. 

E_n=O(n)
